# Overview 

The biggest problem to any health problems today is the food we eat and water we drink, because of irregular  diets we find it really difficult to understand what we eat how much is it going to affect us.

Once we put on weight and land up into any health problems we then approach a dietician who takes charges up a hefty price to provide us a diet plan. which again falls on us as how much we follow it.

This brings us to a need to someone tell us what we are eating how much would that cause to our health.

So here we tried to create  an app that is personalised to your needs and your data and tell whats good for your health.

Smart Dietician is an app that is built to address this particular problem where users can register into it and every-time you wish to eat something just take an image and upload in the app.

The app would tell you how much calories you are going to consume and would that be good for your health considering youâ€™r height, weight and current activity.

This being the MVP version we have just tried to prototype the concept where you just upload a pic and provide how much calories one is going to take in.

Future work
- Integrate with Fit-bit users data to provide Live recommendations 
- Track activities and provide what you should consume now for a better health
- Forecast any health problems 
- What food you should avoid and what food to choose.
